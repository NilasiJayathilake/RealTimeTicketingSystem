# RealTimeTicketingSystem
Real-Time Event Ticketing System
A comprehensive and scalable real-time event management and ticketing system that integrates a command-line interface (CLI) with a full-stack web application. The system is designed to manage multiple events simultaneously, supporting vendors and customers for seamless ticket selling and purchasing.

Features
General Features
Multi-Event Support: Host multiple events concurrently.
Multi-Vendor and Multi-Customer Support: Enables vendors to sell tickets and customers to purchase tickets in real time.
Real-Time Simulations: Simulates ticketing scenarios for each event, showcasing system capabilities.
Multi-Threading: Java-based multithreading ensures efficient handling of concurrent operations.
CRUD Operations: Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for events, vendors, and system configurations.
Full-Stack Application Features
Admin Dashboard (Frontend - React.js)
View and manage events, vendors, and system configurations.
Add new events and vendors with a user-friendly interface.
Run simulations for ticketing events directly from the dashboard.
Real-time progress updates via WebSockets (planned).
Backend (Spring Boot)
Handles business logic and real-time simulations.
Provides REST APIs for frontend communication.
Manages data persistence with MySQL.
Logs system activities in a text file for debugging and audit purposes.
Configuration management using JSON files for flexible and dynamic settings.
Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Lightweight and efficient tool for managing events and running simulations.
Suitable for quick operations and testing.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Java (JDK 11 or higher)
Node.js (v16 or higher)
MySQL Server
Gradle (for backend)
Postman (for API testing)
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Full-Stack-Project/Backend  
Update the application.properties file with your MySQL configuration.

Build and run the backend using Gradle:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew clean build  
java -jar build/libs/your-backend-jar-file.jar  
Create a MySQL database and ensure the application connects successfully.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Full-Stack-Project/Frontend  
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install  
Start the frontend:
bash
Copy code
npm start  
CLI Setup
Compile the CLI application:
bash
Copy code
javac CLI/Main.java  
Run the CLI application:
bash
Copy code
java CLI.Main  
Running API Calls via Postman
Since the frontend is not fully implemented, follow these steps to configure the system and run simulations via Postman:

Add an Event
URL: http://localhost:8080/event/addEvent
Method: POST
JSON Body:
json
Copy code
{  
  "eventName": "Sample Event",  
  "location": "Any Location",  
  "eventDate": "2023-11-22",  
  "eventTime": "2023-11-22T13:37:00",  
  "noOfTickets": 100,  
  "noOfVendors": 2  
}  
Add Multiple Vendors
URL: http://localhost:8080/vendors/addVendors
Method: POST
JSON Body:
json
Copy code
[  
  { "vendorName": "Food Fiesta", "vendorEmail": "foodfiesta@example.com" },  
  { "vendorName": "Tech Gadgets", "vendorEmail": "techgadgets@example.com" },  
  { "vendorName": "Fashion Corner", "vendorEmail": "fashioncorner@example.com" },  
  { "vendorName": "Bookworm's Paradise", "vendorEmail": "bookwormsparadise@example.com" },  
  { "vendorName": "Art & Craft Bazaar", "vendorEmail": "artcraftbazaar@example.com" }  
]  
Assign Vendors to an Event
URL: http://localhost:8080/event/{eventId}/assignVendors
Method: POST
JSON Body:
json
Copy code
{  
  "vendorId1": noOfTickets,  
  "vendorId2": noOfTickets  
}  
Save Configuration
URL: http://localhost:8080/config/saveConfig
Method: POST
JSON Body:
json
Copy code
{  
  "maxTicketCapacity": 20,  
  "ticketRate": 1000,  
  "ticketReleaseRate": 4,  
  "retrievalRate": 4  
}
